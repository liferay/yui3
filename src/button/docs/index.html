# Button

The Button component for YUI 3 is a light-weight, Y.Base wrapper around DOM elements you'd like treated like a button.  This includes things like look &amp; feel, state management, and accessibility.  

## Basics
There are two ways to create a Y.Button instance. 

`// Dynamically create the node
var button = new Y.Button();

// Or, use an existing node
var button = new Y.Button({
    srcNode: "#myButton"
})
`

In either case, you will receive a Y.Button instance that contains a few attributes, and wraps around a Y.Node instance.  The markup generated will look something similar to:

<button id="myButton" aria-selected="false" class="yui3-button" role="button" aria-pressed="false">This is a Y.Button</button>

At this point, you can modify `button`'s attributes, manipulate its state, or listen for change events.

## Events

Most commonly with button elements, you want to listen for any clicks that occur.  That can be achieved with something like this...

`
var button = new Y.Button({
    srcNode: "#myButton"
});

button.on('click', function(){
    alert("Hello!");
});
`

You can also pass in groups of events at instantiation:

`
var button = new Y.Button({
    srcNode: '#myButton',
    type: 'toggle',
    on: {
        click: function(){
            Y.log('This will fire when the button is clicked.')
        },
        focus: function(){
            Y.log('The button is now focused')
        },
        selectedChange: function(){
            Y.log('This will fire when the toggled state changed')
        }
    }
})
`

Any event handlers can also be assigned by using the `on` property in the configuration object.  Valid events include any <a href="">DOM events</a>, as well as Y.Button attribute change events (e.g. 'selectedChange').  

So what do you get from Y.Button over just creating your own, via `new Y.Node.create('<button></button>')`?  
- Accessibility - Your buttons automatically create and manage their own ARIA states.  This includes `aria-selected` and `aria-pressed`.  Y.Button instances also automatically get the `role='button'` attribute to properly identify their purpose (as a button) to screen readers even if they are not a <button> or <input type="button"> element.
- State management - Y.Button instances automatically apply classes, such as yui3-button-selected, yui3-button-disabled, and yui3-button-focused, which are useful for styling purposes. Also, assigning a type of 'toggle' will fire a 'selectedChange' event only when it's state changes from selected to unselected, or vice-versa, eliminating the classical case of listening for 'click' and then checking to see if the state changed.

Note: In the future, Y.Button instances will be capable of being assigned to groups and managed via a new ButtonGroup module.

## Styling
YUI's Button component was designed with the idea in mind that you may only want button styles, no JS functionality.  Instead of `use('button')`, you can just include the `cssbutton` sub-module.  This can be done either dynamically by `use('cssbutton')` or statically with a <link> tag.  Including this module will load in a stylesheet consisting of the following classes:
- yui3-button
- yui3-button:hover
- yui3-button:active
- yui3-button-disabled

These styles are designed to progressively enhance.  In legacy browsers, you'll get styles that appear a bit nicer than native buttons, and in modern browsers you'll get buttons using the latest styles that CSS3 has to offer.
